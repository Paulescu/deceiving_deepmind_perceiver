    "# How to fool DeepMind Perceiver in 10 minutes with adversarial examples\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâüèΩ [DeepMind Perceiver](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/building-architectures-that-can-handle-the-worlds-data) was released in 2021. It's a transformer-based model that can handle data from arbitrary settings, including images, videos, text, or audio. This model is one solid step toward truly general architectures, as opposed to task-specific, that can process arbitrary sequences of inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâüèΩ In this notebook, we will generate and adversarial example that manages to fool this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâüèΩ We will use the implementation of the Perceiver available in [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/deepmind/vision-perceiver-learned#how-to-use) model repository."

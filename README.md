## What is this repo about?

Would you say Deep Learning models have become so good, that robust AI systems are no longer a dream, but a reality?

Do you think you can safely use the latest models published by researchers in any real-world problem, like self-driving cars? Or face recognition software at airports?

Convinced that machines are already better than humans at processing and understanding images?

I was too. Until I realized it is possible to deceive a state-of-the-art model, like DeepMind Perceiver, with a few lines of code

In this repo, I show you how.

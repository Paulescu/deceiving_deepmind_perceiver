## What is this repo about?

Do you think that cutting-edge Deep Learning models, like DeepMind Perceiver, are bullet-proof systems, that are impossible to fool?

Or that you can safely use these models in any real-world problem, like self-driving cars?

Do you think it is impossible to fool a Deep Learning model, like DeepMind Perceiver, developed by some of the brightest AI researchers in the world?

Well, you are WRONG.

In this repo, we will learn how to fool a state-of-the-art model, like DeepMind Perceiver IO, through a hands-on example, in less than 10 minutes.
